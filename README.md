# Daily-Amongus-Twitter-Bot
A twitter bot which posts an image with an auto generated sentence (related to the hit game among us) every four hours.
This bot was mainly designed as a joke, although it was also to test making a twitter bot, and editing images using python.
It really isn't anything interesting or complicated, i just found it fun and interesting to make/use :)

Check it out [here](https://twitter.com/amongusdaily).

## What I Learnt
I learnt how to use the Tweepy library, as well as the Pillow library. Funnily enough, the hardest part of this was using the Twitter developer portal, which wasn't hard persay, but none the less it was annoying to use, in my opinion.

##Next Steps
I do want to make a good twitter bot that I can host on my rasbperry pi, but I need to think of a good idea first. If you think of a good idea, feel free to comment or contact me. I'd love to make something really interesting. (My original idea was a twitter bot that posted everytime a plane lands on mount everest).
